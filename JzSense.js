/**
 * @classdesc An "Asset" serves as an abstraction between the presentation of a content file and the actual file that resides on disk; it is a "container" for information about a content file.



At a minimum, an asset contains a reference to the relative path and filename of a file.



Metadata



When the Content Management System (CMS) is active, an asset provides an interface to its metadata within the content database. This metadata includes information such as what type of asset it is, what it is used for, what it is compatible with, which category(ies) it is presented to the user in, etc.



Conceptually, each asset belongs to exactly one "Product". By default, and until/unless modified, all newly created assets are assigned to the "LOCAL USER" product. An asset is uniquely identified within a product by the combination of its relative path and filename. While any number of products can reference a file with the same relative path and filename combination, each product's concept of that combination is unique (even if their metadata is identical).



The metadata for a given asset is divided into 2 distinct types; that which is owned and/or maintained by the vendor (the originating source), and that which is owned and/or maintained by the end-user. Unless the metadata component (e.g., userKeywords, userNotes, etc), the product (e.g., "LOCAL USER"), or the store (e.g., "LOCAL USER") indicate "user" in their name, any assumption (if there is to be one) about which type the data is should be that which is owned and/or maintained by the vendor.



The metadata for an asset that is "installed" and which belongs to a product associated with a "Store" (source) other than the "LOCAL USER" store is owned by the vendor. Conversely, the metadata for an asset that is created by the user and/or belongs to a product associated with the "LOCAL USER" store is owned by the user. The exceptions to this are those attributes which integrate "user" into their name; which in fact always belong to the user.



The significance of the distinction between the 2 types of metadata comes down to how the data is handled during an update and whether or not an effort is made to preserve it. Metadata that is owned and/or maintained by the vendor can be summarily purged during an update. This provides a vendor with the means to clean up all potential prior versions of the metadata witout being faced with complex bookkeeping tasks.

 * @classdesc A DzComboEdit provides a compound widget comprised of a line edit and a button that, when clicked, causes a menu to be displayed. Selecting one of the items in the popup menu causes the value of the editor to update with the text of the selected item by default. A separator can be created in a menu by using a single hyphen ("-") character. Sub-menus can be created by using two consecutive greater than ("»") characters as a delimiter between the entries of a given hierarchy.

The DForm Base draws itself in the scene using the DForm_base_ColorMax and DForm_base_ColorMin embedded geometry. The DForm_base_ColorMax is drawn with the maximum color of the vertex weight color gradient and the DForm_base_ColorMin is drawn with the minimum color.

/**
 * @classdesc Classes derived from DzElement may have any number of properties (objects derived from DzProperty). Those properties may be added and removed at runtime and may be specified as animatable or not. There are several types of properties that have been supplied with the Studio SDK. Property names must be unique within an element. A variety of methods are provided to allow easy traversal and/or searching of the properties list for an object.



Methods are provided to clear animation data on all properties of an object either over a range or over all time.



DzElement takes ownership of all properties added via addProperty(). Subclasses should not attempt to delete properties that have been added to the element.



DzElement also handles saving and loading of all properties. When DzElement loads a property from a file, it will delete any existing property of the same name and replace it with the new property read in - subclasses are responsible for updating any local references to properties whenever a file is loaded. The easiest and most reliable way to do this is for the subclass to write out and read back in any local pointers it maintains to properties. Another approach would be for the subclass to reimplement the postLoadFile() function and update its references by calling findProperty() to lookup the properties by name.

The controller node (the DzNode that the controlling property is located on) and the controller property (the DzNumericProperty that ultimately does the controlling) must be set before calling doFreeze(); see setControllerNode() and setControllerProperty().



An additional property can be set and used to attentuate the effect of the controller property on the 'frozen' properties, or have its value attenuated as the controller property is applied, depending on the AttenuateMode set.



The addPropertiesToFreeze() method is used to inspect the current state of the numeric properties on a a given node that are not currently set to their respective raw values and add them to the list of those properties to be linked to the controller property. This list of properties can be inspected and/or modified using the getPropertiesToFreeze() and setPropertiesToFreeze() methods.

/**
 * @classdesc This numeric controller implements an algorithm that is based on the value of another property. There are six formulas which correspond to the ERCType of the object - the default ERCType is ERCDeltaAdd. The formulas are:


 ERCDeltaAdd: f(v) = v + (c * m) + a

 ERCDivideInto: f(v) = (c / v) + a

 ERCDivideBy: f(v) = (v / c) + a

 ERCMultiply: f(v) = (c * v) + a

 ERCSubtract: f(v) = v - c + a

 ERCAdd: f(v) = v + c + a

 ERCKeyed: f(v) = v + P©




Where:


 v is the current (keyed) value of the property with the link

 c is the current (final) value of the property that the link is driven by

 m is an optional scalar multiplier

 a is an optional offset (additive) value.




As an example of ERC in action, lets say that there are 3 properties A, B, and C. B is linked to A with a 'ERCDeltaAdd' DzERCLink with a multiplier of 1.0 and an additive value of 0.0. C is linked to B with a 'ERCDeltaAdd' DzERCLink with a multiplier of 2.0 and an additive value of 1.0. So, if the keyed value of A is 10.0, B is 0.0, and C is 0.0, the final values of the properties would be calculated as:



A = 10.0 B = 0.0 + (10.0 * 1.0) + 0.0 = 10.0 C = 0.0 + (10.0 * 2.0) + 1.0 = 21.0



If B and C have keyed values - for example B is 5.0 and C is 2.0 - the final property values would be calculated as:



A = 10.0 B = 5.0 + (10.0 * 1.0) + 0.0 = 15.0 C = 2.0 + (15.0 * 2.0) + 1.0 = 33.0

There is only one instance of this manager in an application. This instance is created and owned by DzApp. Don't create an instance of this class, but rather request it from DzApp via DzApp.getFileIOPresetMgr().



File I/O presets are defined by a unique name. They have two types of settings: Specific Settings and Common Settings.



Specific Settings

 Specific settings are tied to a class name. This class name is typically, but not always, the name of an importer or exporter, such as "DzObjImporter" or "DzObjExporter." The key values for specific settings will vary based on the class.



Common Settings

 Common settings for a preset are common to all class names. These include settings that define scale values and axis settings. Common keys can be accessed via the following methods:  * getLateralAxisKey()


 getVerticalAxisKey()

 getDepthAxisKey()

 getInvertLateralAxisKey()

 getInvertVerticalAxisKey()

 getInvertDepthAxisKey()

 getScaleKey()




The scale value used by the presets is for importers. If you are working with an exporter then the scale value needs to be converted to 1/scale. As an example, if the scale value for a preset is 2.54 then the scale value for an exporter would be 1/2.54 = 0.3937

/**
 * @classdesc The DzMessageBox class is available in DAZScript via Global.MessageBox.



It provides functions that display pre-built message boxes to the user. This is the easiest way for a script to interact with a user - simply call one of the functions as shown in the following examples:



Example:



Display an information box with an 'Ok' button

MessageBox.information( qsTr("MyScript finished successfully."), qsTr("MyScript"), qsTr("&OK") );


Example:



Ask the user a question with 'Yes'/'No' buttons

if( MessageBox.question( qsTr("Do you want to reset the entire figure?"), qsTr("MyScript"), qsTr("&Yes"), qsTr("&No") ) == 0 ){
	resetEntireFigure();
}


Example:



Display a warning message to the user

if( MessageBox.warning( qsTr("If you continue, the entire figure will be reset!"), qsTr("MyScript"), qsTr("&OK"), qsTr("&Cancel") ) == 1 ){
	return;
}


Example:



Display a critical message to the user

var error = doSomething();
if( error != 0 ){
	MessageBox.critical( qsTr("The script has encountered a critical error!"), qsTr("MyScript"), qsTr("&OK") );
	return;

/**
 * @classdesc DzNode objects all contain animatable position, rotation, and scale channels that can be set and accessed via the properties list in the DzElement class or through specialized calls in this class.



The transform order is Translate/Rotate/Scale. Non-uniform scaling is supported by implementing seperate X, Y, and Z scale channels. All channels are independent internally and can have keys set on them independent of any other channel.



Note that channel independence holds exactly true for translations and scales, but does not hold for rotations (which are represented as Euler angle degrees in each channel). Euler angles are inherently inter-dependent and prone to numerical singularities (gimbals) that make them less than perfect at representing rotations. For this reason, rotations are handled as DzQuat objects whenever possible. When setting keys on a DzNode, it is prefferable to use the set*Rot() methods or set*Transform() methods that take DzQuat arguments. Setting rotations as a DzQuat will create keys on all three rotation channels but will assure that the values are reasonable.



Nodes have an origin and an orientation that define their default state. The origin is the center point of the node and is given in untransformed world space. In other words, the origin is the center point of the node in relation to its untransformed and undeformed geometry. The orientation of the node defines the space in which this node's rotations occur. Orientation only has an effect on the rotation of the node, it does not affect translation or scale transforms.



Each node defines a local axis that is determined by evaluating the transforms of all nodes in the parent tree for this node in order.



Several functions are provided for accessing the transformation data of a node. Below are descriptions of the groups of functions, and the transform space that they return data for.


 World Space Transforms:getWSTransform(), getWSPos(), getWSRot(), getWSScale() WS (world space) transforms are just that - the transformation of the node into world space, including keyed transformation data. These functions essentially traverse up the hierarchy evaluating the local transforms for each parent node, resulting in the final World Space transform of the node.



 Local Transforms:getLocalTransform(), getLocalPos(), getLocalRot(), getLocalScale() Local transforms are the full transformation of the node in the space of its immediate parent - for root nodes, the nodes origin added to the local pos is equivalent to the worldspace transform.




Classes derived from DzNode may also be drawn in the interactive 3D views (via the draw() method) or/and may be rendered using a RenderMan- compliant renderer (via the render() method).

 * @classdesc This is the base class for all controllers that can control the value of a DzNumericProperty-derived object. DzNumericProperty objects can have multiple controllers, these controllers are applied in the order they appear in the controller list.



The application of controllers in a DzNumeric-derived property begins with the keyed (raw) value of the property at the given time, this is the value that is passed to the apply() function of the first controller. The result returned by the apply() call to the first controller is then passed into the apply() function on the second controller, and so on. The result returned by the apply() function of the last controller on the property is then returned as the final value of the property for the given time.



The applyInverse function is used to determine the keyed (raw) value of the property when the user enters a number for the final value of the property. Controllers which have an 'Additive' effect must reimplement this method so that the value of the property appears to respond correctly to user input. Controllers which have a 'Replace' effect need not reimplement this function, since they have no inverse because they do not use the raw value of the property in their calculation.

/**
 * @classdesc A "Pane" is the application's implementation of a persistent non-modal set of closely related widgets that can be stacked, ordered, docked, undocked, minimized, restored, shown, hidden, positioned and/or resized by the end-user.



Each pane has a label that is attached to the outer perimeter of the pane; whether the label appears as a tab/button/etc. to the user depends on the "style" that they currently has applied. A pane's label should briefly describe the concept (product, service, etc.) presented to the user within the pane.



Actions performed by the user that are closely related to the concept of a given pane, but do not warrant a persitent widget within the pane itself, or are more advanced in nature, should be considered for placement with the pane's option menu.



A pane is only ever displayed to the user within a DzPaneGroup; this is what gives the pane its ability to be stacked, ordered, docked, undocked, minimized, restored, shown, hidden, positioned and/or resized. A pane can only ever exist within one DzPaneGroup at a time.



Panes are singletons; there is only one instance of a given DzPane subclass. Panes are registered with DzPaneMgr and are available to access and modifiy via script. Use DzPaneMgr.findPane() to obtain a pointer to the single instance of the subclass, using its classname.

/**
 * @classdesc The "Product" container type represents a collection of assets (and supporting files/metadata) that are presented as a single entity to the end-user. Each product is assigned a Globally Unique Idendtifier (GUID) that is used to identify that entity within the content ecosystem. Once a GUID has been assigned to a product (at creation), it does not (and should not) change.



While nearly all of the information that defines a product can be replicated into another, for logistical reasons a GUID can only be associated with one "Store" (source) at any single moment in its lifetime. This means that if more than one content package containing metadata that defines a given GUID is installed by an end-user, the last package installed will define the product in the database.



By default, all newly created assets are assigned to a "LOCAL USER" product. This product is represented by a GUID consisting entirely of zeros; i.e., "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"



The "LOCAL USER" product is associated with the "LOCAL USER" store (source); this cannot be modified.

/**
 * @classdesc DzRadioButton and DzCheckBox are both option buttons (e.g. they can be checked or unchecked). They differ in how the available choices are restricted. A DzCheckBox is used to define several choices that can all co-exist at the same time (e.g. "many of many"). While a DzRadioButton is used to provide several choices, where only one can be ultimately chosen (e.g. "one of many").



The easiest way to implement a "one of many" type choice is to create radio buttons as children of a DzButtonGroup.



Example:

// Create a new dialog
var wDlg = new DzDialog;
wDlg.caption = "DzRadioButton Example";
 
// Create a layout for the dialog
var wLyt = new DzVBoxLayout( wDlg );
wLyt.autoAdd = true;
 
// Create a button group for the options
var wOptBG = new DzVButtonGroup( wDlg );
wOptBG.columns = 1;
 
// Create the options
var wOpt1Btn = new DzRadioButton( wOptBG );
wOpt1Btn.text = "Option 1";
wOpt1Btn.checked = true;
var wOpt2Btn = new DzRadioButton( wOptBG );
wOpt2Btn.text = "Option 2";
var wOpt3Btn = new DzRadioButton( wOptBG );
wOpt3Btn.text = "Option 3";
 
// Launch the dialog
wDlg.exec();

/**
 * @classdesc This class provides the ability to define RSL shaders for the elements that can use them (DzShaderMaterial, DzShaderLight, DzShaderCamera).



Optimizations:



Two methods in this class that should not be overlooked are setActiveInShadowPass() and setOnlyInShadowPass(), as they can have a significant impact on render times.



In the context of Surface shaders, the data members set by these methods are used to identify whether the shader participates during the shadow [map] pass - the pass for each contributing light in the scene that indicates the use of Deep Shadow Maps for shadows. This affords developers a couple of key benifits:


 One key benifit is the ability to use a single Displacement shader in both the shadow pass as well as the beauty pass. Not only does this alleviate the duplication of code, but by utilizing a Displacement shader for any bump/diplacement operations, rendering times become much faster than performing the same operations in a Surface shader. This is due to the frequency that the shader code is executed. Displacement shaders are evaluated once, at the begining of a pass, and a caching mechanism for the displaced geometry is used as the render progresses. When the same code is placed in a Surface shader, the bump/displacment calculations are performed at every evaluation of the surface.

 Another key benifit is the ability to use a highly optimized Surface shader during the shadow [map] pass, which can have a significant impact on the time required to generate a shadow map - and thus complete the render.




In the context of Light shaders, the data members set by these methods are used to identify whether this shader participates when the DzLight.ShadowType indicates shadowing is used. This affords developers the benifit of being able to use Light shaders that are optimized for either condition.



Property Naming:



Standard Shader and Materials Presets make an effort to copy as much as possible from one element to the next via DzElement.copyFrom(). In order for this to occur, the properties must match in both name and type. Provided below are the names and types used by DzDefaultMaterial, DzLight, DzDistantLight, DzSpotLight and DzPointLight in the event that you would like use properties that will work with the copyFrom() method.

/**
 * @classdesc Represents a URI as it is used for the DSON file format. DzUri provides functionality in addition to standard URI/URL representations that is specific to the DSON file format.



DzUri provides for a traditional URI with path and fragment portions. In addition, it further divides the fragment into 1 to 3 parts for ease of use in the DSON file format. The following is an example of a URI as represented by the DzURI class:



/Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf.rCollar?rotation/x



The file path portion of this URI is: "/Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf"



The fragment portion of this URI is: "rCollar?rotation/x"



The fragment is further divided into an identifier and a property path. In this case the identifier is "rCollar" and the property path is "rotation/x".



All the sections of the fragment are optional, however, to be valid, each section in the fragment requires the preceding section to also be valid. So, the following URIs are valid:


 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf.rCollar

 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf.rCollar?rotation

 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf.rCollar?rotation/x




And the following URIs are not valid:


 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf#?rotation/x

 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf#?/x

 /Converted/Victoria4/Victoria4.dsf#?rotation

/**
 * @classdesc This class was added to DAZ Studio 4.x to make it easier to work with 64-bit version numbers and to facilitate compatibility with the old 32-bit version numbers.



Version numbers are typically displayed to the user as short version strings, e.g. 4.0, or long version strings, e.g. 4.0.0.0.



The version number consists of 4 components: The Major version number, the Minor version number, the Revision number, and the Build number. This is displayed in the following order: Major.Minor.Revision.Build.



In DAZ Studio, version numbers are typically stored as 64-bit unsigned integers with 16 bits for each number. This means that each number has a valid range of 0-65535. The most significant 16 bits are the Major version number, the next most significant 16 bits are the Minor version number, the next most significant 16 bits are the Revision number and the least significant 16 bits are the Build number. So, a packed version number in hexadecimal notation might look like: 0x1111222233334444 where 1111 is the Major version number, 2222 is the Minor version number 3333 is the Revision number and 4444 is the build number.



It is recommended that this class be used when possible to reduce confusion when dealing with version numbers in code.



This class provides methods for all of the numerical comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) to make it easy to compare version numbers without directly using the packed value, or the individual components.
